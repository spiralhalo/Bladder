# Bladder

A mod that adds Bladder system to Minecraft (WIP).

Right now it only adds a toilet block that players can sit on.

I haven't decided on a license, so redistribution is currently prohibited. Feel free to download the code and compile it for your own personal use, but without any warranty.

I will add a more permissive license in the future when the actual mechanic that I wanted to make is implemeted. Until then, I'm not accepting contributions either.

If you want to make use of some Bladder's codes on your own project, the package `spiralhalo.bladder.util` is already CC0 so feel free to do whatever you want with those. The assets including models and textures on the other hand are probably ARR forever because I love my toilet model too much, sorry.
